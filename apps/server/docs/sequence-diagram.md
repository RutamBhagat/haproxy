    Note over Client,Slack: Normal operation - HAProxy1 is Master with VIP

    rect rgb(230, 255, 230)
        Note over KeepAlive1,KeepAlive2: HAProxy1 recovery (rejoins as backup)

        KeepAlive1->>KeepAlive2: VRRP heartbeat (Priority 101 vs 100)
        Note over KeepAlive2: Receives Master with higher priority<br/>Gracefully becomes BACKUP

        Note over KeepAlive1,KeepAlive2: HAProxy1 could reclaim VIP, but<br/>typically configured to stay as backup<br/>to avoid unnecessary service disruption

        KeepAlive1->>KeepAlive2: VRRP heartbeat confirmation
        Note over KeepAlive2: Continue as MASTER<br/>HAProxy1 stays as hot standby
