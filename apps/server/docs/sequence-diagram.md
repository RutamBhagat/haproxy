## 2. Health Monitoring & Alerting Flow

```mermaid

    participant Monitor as Health Monitor<br/>(Alpine Container)
    participant HAStats as HAProxy Stats<br/>(Port 8404)
    participant StateFile as State File<br/>(/tmp/pgbouncer_states.txt)

    Note over Monitor,Slack: Monitoring loop runs every 10 seconds

    loop Every 10 seconds
        Monitor->>HAStats: GET /stats (CSV format)
        activate HAStats
        
        HAStats-->>Monitor: CSV data with<br/>server statuses
        deactivate HAStats
        
        Note over Monitor: Parse CSV for<br/>pgb1, pgb2, pgb3 status

        Monitor->>StateFile: Read previous<br/>states
        activate StateFile
        
        StateFile-->>Monitor: Previous states<br/>(e.g., pgb1:UP)
        
        alt State Change Detected
            Note over Monitor: pgb2: UP â†’ DOWN
            
            Monitor->>Slack: POST Alert<br/>"{title: 'PgBouncer Alert',<br/>message: 'pgb2 is DOWN'}"
            activate Slack
            
            Slack-->>Monitor: 200 OK
            deactivate Slack
            
            Monitor->>StateFile: Update state<br/>pgb2:DOWN
            
        else No Change
            Note over Monitor: All states unchanged
        end
        
        deactivate StateFile
    end

    Note over Monitor: Continuous monitoring ensures high availability

## 3. PgBouncer Failover Scenario

    participant Client as Client
    participant HAProxy as HAProxy
    participant PGB1 as PgBouncer 1<br/>(pgb1)
    participant PGB2 as PgBouncer 2<br/>(pgb2)
    participant PGB3 as PgBouncer 3<br/>(pgb3)
    participant Monitor as Health Monitor
    participant Slack as Slack

    Note over Client,Slack: Normal operation - all PgBouncers healthy

    Client->>HAProxy: Query 1
    HAProxy->>PGB1: Route (healthy)
    PGB1-->>HAProxy: Response
    HAProxy-->>Client: Result

    Client->>HAProxy: Query 2
    HAProxy->>PGB2: Route (healthy)
    PGB2-->>HAProxy: Response
    HAProxy-->>Client: Result

    Note over PGB2: PgBouncer 2 crashes

    rect rgb(255, 230, 230)
        Note over HAProxy,PGB2: Health check failure detection
        
        HAProxy->>PGB2: Health Check 1
        PGB2--xHAProxy: Timeout
        
        HAProxy->>PGB2: Health Check 2
        PGB2--xHAProxy: Timeout
        
        HAProxy->>PGB2: Health Check 3
        PGB2--xHAProxy: Timeout
        
        Note over HAProxy: After 3 failures (6s)<br/>Mark pgb2 as DOWN
    end

    Monitor->>HAProxy: Check status
    HAProxy-->>Monitor: pgb2: DOWN
    Monitor->>Slack: Alert: pgb2 is DOWN

    Note over Client,PGB3: System continues with remaining PgBouncers

    Client->>HAProxy: Query 3
    HAProxy->>PGB1: Route (skip pgb2)
    PGB1-->>HAProxy: Response
    HAProxy-->>Client: Result

    Client->>HAProxy: Query 4
    HAProxy->>PGB3: Route (skip pgb2)
    PGB3-->>HAProxy: Response
    HAProxy-->>Client: Result

    Note over PGB2: Admin runs: docker start pgb2

    rect rgb(230, 255, 230)
        Note over HAProxy,PGB2: Recovery detection
        
        HAProxy->>PGB2: Health Check
        PGB2-->>HAProxy: Success
        
        HAProxy->>PGB2: Health Check 2
        PGB2-->>HAProxy: Success
        
        Note over HAProxy: After 2 successes (4s)<br/>Mark pgb2 as UP
    end

    Monitor->>HAProxy: Check status
    HAProxy-->>Monitor: pgb2: UP
    Monitor->>Slack: Recovery: pgb2 is back UP

    Note over Client,Slack: System back to full capacity
